  Advice for this homework:
  <ol class="problem">
    <li>
      Words are simply strings separated by whitespace. Note that words which
      only differ in capitalization are considered separate (e.g.
      <i>great</i> and <i>Great</i> are considered different words).
    </li>
    <li>
      You might find some useful functions in <code>util.py</code>. Have a look
      around in there before you start coding.
    </li>

  <div class="problemTitle">Problem 1: Building intuition</div>

  <p>
    Here are two reviews of <i>Frozen</i>, courtesy of
    <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (no spoilers!):
  </p>

  <p>
    Rotten Tomatoes has classified these reviews as "positive" and "negative,",
    respectively, as indicated by the intact tomato on the left and the
    splattered tomato on the right. In this assignment, you will create a simple
    text classification system that can perform this task automatically.
  </p>

  <ol class="problem">
    We'll warm up with the following set of four mini-reviews, each labeled
    positive $(+1)$ or negative $(-1)$:
    <ol>
      <li>$(-1)$ pretty bad</li>
      <li>$(+1)$ good plot</li>
      <li>$(-1)$ not good</li>
      <li>$(+1)$ pretty scenery</li>
    </ol>
    Each review $x$ is mapped onto a feature vector $\phi(x)$, which maps each
    word to the number of occurrences of that word in the review. For example,
    the first review maps to the (sparse) feature vector $\phi(x) =
    \{\text{pretty}:1, \text{bad}:1\}$. Recall the definition of the hinge loss:
    $$\text{Loss}_{\text{hinge}}(x, y, \mathbf{w}) = \max \{0, 1 - \mathbf{w}
    \cdot \phi(x) y\},$$ where $x$ is the review text, $y$ is the correct label,
    $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector.

    <li class="writeup" id="1a">
      Suppose we run stochastic gradient descent once for each of the 4 samples
      in the order given above, updating the weights according to $$\mathbf{w}
      \leftarrow \mathbf{w} - \eta \nabla_\mathbf{w}
      \text{Loss}_{\text{hinge}}(x, y, \mathbf{w}).$$ After the updates, what
      are the weights of the six words ("pretty", "good", "bad", "plot", "not",
      "scenery") that appear in the above reviews? Use $\eta = .5$ as the step
      size and initialize $\mathbf{w} = [0, ..., 0]$. Assume that
      $\nabla_\mathbf{w} \text{Loss}_{\text{hinge}}(x, y, \mathbf{w}) = 0$ when
      the margin is exactly 1.
      <div class="expected">
        A weight vector that contains a numerical value for each of the tokens
        in the reviews ("pretty", "good", "bad","plot", "not", "scenery").
        Please label your weight vector, indicating which word corresponds to
        each weight value.
      </div>
    </li>

    <li class="writeup" id="1b">
      Create a small labeled dataset of four mini-reviews using the words "not",
      "good", and "bad", where the labels make intuitive sense. Each review
      should contain one or two words, and no repeated words. No two reviews in
      the dataset should be the same.
      <br /><br />
      Prove that no linear classifier using word features can get zero error on
      your dataset. Remember that this is a question about classifiers, not
      optimization algorithms; your proof should be true for any linear
      classifier, regardless of how the weights are learned.
      <br /><br />
      Propose a single additional feature for your dataset that we could augment
      the feature vector with that would fix this problem.

      <div class="expected">
        <ol>
          <li>
            a small dataset of reviews (the dataset should only contain examples
            using the words "not", "good", and "bad").
          </li>
          <li>a short written proof (~3-5 sentences).</li>
          <li>
            a viable feature that would allow a linear classifier to have zero
            error on the dataset (classify all examples correctly).

  <div class="problemTitle">Problem 2: Predicting Movie Ratings</div>
  <ol class="problem">
    <p>
      Suppose that we are now interested in predicting a numeric rating for
      movie reviews. We will use a non-linear predictor that takes a movie
      review $x$ and returns $\sigma(\mathbf w \cdot \phi(x))$, where $\sigma(z)
      = (1 + e^{-z})^{-1}$ is the logistic function that squashes a real number
      to the range $(0, 1)$. Suppose that we wish to use the squared loss. For
      this problem, assume that the movie rating $y$ is a real-valued variable
      in the range $[0, 1]$.

      minimize the magnitude of the gradient). Can the magnitude of the gradient

      <p>
        Motivation: the reason why we're interested in the magnitude of the
        gradients is because it governs how far gradient descent will step. For
        example, if the gradient is close to zero when $\mathbf w$ is very far
        from the optimum, then it could take a long time for gradient descent to
        reach the optimum (if at all). This is known as the

  In this problem, we will build a binary linear classifier that reads movie

  Only standard python libraries and/or the libraries imported in the starter
  code are allowed. In this problem, you must implement the functions without
  using libraries like Scikit-learn.

  <ol class="problem">

      Use this to double check that your
